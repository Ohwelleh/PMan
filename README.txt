To compile my PMan program:
    Run make or Make in the terminal

To execute PMan:
    Type ./PMan in the terminal

At any point type "stop" to completely exit PMan:
    This will kill all processes stored in the linked list data structure
    As well as free all the memory the was allocated for the nodes in the linked list.
